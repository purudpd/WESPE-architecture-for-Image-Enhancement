# WESPE-architecture-for-Image-Enhancement

The following is the implementation of WESPE architecture for image enhancement. This is based on the follow-up paper to DPED architecture from ETH Zurich. The project page can be found here: https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/wespe.html

The code is modified from the original DPED code released by authors. No source code was released for WESPE. Unfortunately, I have been unable to reproduce the results given in the "WESPE" paper.
